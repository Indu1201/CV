		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<li>Development, verification and validation of Floating point code and Fixed point code for Powertrain systems.</li>
		<h3>Project Description</h3>
		<p><strong>Floating Point process:</strong> The aim of this process was to convert the given specification into embedded c code using Simulink coder and perform MIL-SIL validation and verification to the specified scenarios of the given MIL tested specification using Matlab and Reactis for C. Combustion, After Treatment, Torque Calculation, Speed management and cooling modules were implemented.
		</p>
		<p><strong>Fixed Point process: </strong>In Unit testing, aim is to convert the given specification into code and to perform unit testing of manually written code with the manual test cases using Reactis for C.  
		Whereas, In SIL validation, testing has been performed to the manually written code of the given specification with auto generated test cases using Reactis for C. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Contribution:</strong>
		<ul>
		<li>Prepared the test cases as per the specification given by customer for Engine Management System. </li>
		<li>Performed MIL-SIL testing for the given (Floating point and Fixed point) specification and the auto generated code (Manual code in case of Floating point) of the respective specification. </li>
		<li>Auto code development and static code analysis has been executed for floating point specification using Matlab. </li>
		<li>Written manual test cases for the given specification which later followed up by the Unit Testing, Code coverage and MCDC checking with the manually written code of the same specification. </li>
		<li>Mentored and trained newly joined trainees and teammates.  </li>
		<li>Reviews and screen of the SIL validation and verification has been taken up of Peers for increasing Product quality. </li>
		<li>Analysing and debugging the developed code against the MIL Model in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment. </li>
		<li>Responsibilities like Planning of modules, Estimation, Module release, Issue confirmations, Module status tracking has been handled. </li>
		</ul></p>
